# Multi-year Blood Lead Level Analysis (SAS)

## Overview
This repository contains a SAS-based epidemiologic analysis
of blood lead level surveillance data collected between 2015
and 2023. The project demonstrates data cleaning, harmonization
across years, exposure categorization, and stratified
descriptive analysis.

## Research Context
Blood lead levels remain a significant public health concern.
This analysis focuses on categorizing exposure levels using
clinically meaningful thresholds and examining distributions
across demographic and temporal variables.

## Methods
- Annual data ingestion and deduplication
- Categorization of blood lead levels
- Data harmonization and cohort stacking
- Stratified frequency analysis by sex, race, ethnicity,
  Medicaid status, county, and test year
- Data visualization using PROC SGPLOT

## Tools
- SAS 9.4

## Reproducibility and Data Access
Original datasets are not included due to data use agreements
and privacy considerations. Simulated data are provided to
illustrate dataset structure and analytic workflow.

## Relevance to Translational Research
The analytic approach demonstrated here—multi-cohort
harmonization, categorical exposure definition, and structured
descriptive analysis—is directly applicable to translational
biomedical research, including large-scale observational and
omics-based studies.
